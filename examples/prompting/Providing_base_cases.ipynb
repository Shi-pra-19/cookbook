Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, then swim back to the beach. If you can't swim to shore, float or tread water and wave for help.\n2.  **Sun Exposure:** The California sun can be intense, even on cloudy days.\n    *   **Danger:** Sunburn, heatstroke, and long-term skin damage.\n    *   **Protection:** Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30, wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and protective clothing. Seek shade, especially between 10 AM and 4 PM. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.\n3.  **Marine Life:** While rare, certain marine life can pose a risk.\n    *   **Stingrays:** Often bury themselves in the sand in shallow water. Stepping on one can result in a painful sting.\n    *   **Prevention:** Do the \"stingray shuffle\" by shuffling your feet along the bottom when wading in shallow water to scare them away.\n    *   **Jellyfish:** Can sometimes be present, and their stings can be irritating.\n    *   **Leopard Sharks:** Are commonly seen in San Diego waters, especially in La Jolla Shores. They are harmless to humans but can be startling.\n4.  **Ocean Conditions (Waves & Tides):** Waves can be powerful, and tides can shift.\n    *   **Shorebreak:** Waves that break directly on the shore can be deceptively strong and can cause injuries if you're knocked over.\n    *   **Tides:** Be aware of incoming tides, especially if you're exploring tide pools or isolated coves, as they can cut off your access back to the main beach.\n    *   **Lifeguards:** Always swim near a lifeguard station and pay attention to any flags or signs they post regarding current conditions.\n5.  **Slippery Rocks/Cliffs:** If you're exploring rocky areas or tide pools, or walking near cliffs (like those in La Jolla or Torrey Pines), be cautious.\n    *   **Danger:** Slipping on wet rocks, falling from cliffs, or being hit by falling rocks.\n    *   **Prevention:** Wear appropriate footwear, stay on marked trails, and do not climb on unstable rocks or cliffs.\n\nEnjoy the beautiful San Diego beaches, but always prioritize your safety!"

Here are three books known for their incredibly well-defined and detailed magic:\n\n1.  **Mistborn: The Final Empire** by Brandon Sanderson\n    *   **Why it fits:** Brandon Sanderson is practically synonymous with hard magic systems, and *Mistborn* is a prime example. Its magic system, Allomancy, involves ingesting and \"burning\" different metals to gain specific powers. The rules are clear, the limitations are present, and the magic feels almost like a science within the world. You learn how it works alongside the characters, and its applications and counters are meticulously explored.\n\n2.  **Unsouled** by Will Wight (Cradle series)\n    *   **Why it fits:** The magic system in *Cradle* is known as the \"Sacred Arts,\" and it's built on a foundation of cultivating vital aura, manipulating madra, and developing specific \"Paths\" with unique techniques. It's a progression fantasy, so the magic is very systematically learned and improved, with clear tiers, methods, and consequences. The internal logic is incredibly strong, and you understand exactly why characters can do what they do.\n\n3.  **The Black Prism** by Brent Weeks (Lightbringer series)\n    *   **Why it fits:** The magic in *Lightbringer* revolves around \"Drafting\" luxin, which is solidified light of different colors. Each color has distinct properties, and there are strict rules about how much one can draft, the dangers of over-drafting, and the consequences of \"breaking the halo.\" The system is intricate, with different abilities tied to different colors, and it's integral to the political and social structure of the world."

Since you didn't specify a genre, I'll recommend two excellent horror novels for you:\n\n1.  **\"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson:** This is a classic for a reason. It's a masterclass in psychological horror, focusing on a small group of people invited to stay in an old, notoriously haunted mansion. The terror comes not just from the house, but from the slow unraveling of the characters' minds. It's incredibly atmospheric and unsettling.\n2.  **\"Mexican Gothic\" by Silvia Moreno-Garcia:** If you enjoy atmospheric, unsettling stories with a touch of the macabre, this is a fantastic choice. It follows a glamorous socialite who travels to a remote, decaying mansion in the Mexican countryside after receiving a disturbing letter from her newlywed cousin. It blends classic gothic horror tropes with a unique historical and cultural setting.\n\nEnjoy your reads!"
